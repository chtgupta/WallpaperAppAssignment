# WallpaperAppAssignment

## A wallpaper app made to demonstrate the use of the following modules and toolkits

* Jetpack Compose
* MvRx Architecture
* Ktor Client
* Moshi
* Pexels API
* Dagger - HILT

> I got this assignment yesterday, and I was not familiar with any of the above-mentioned technologies. Developing an app on speedrun with a new tech stack was exciting. I still have some doubts but overall it was a great experience.
